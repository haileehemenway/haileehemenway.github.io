<h2> Background: </h2>

<p> I grew up in several different towns arranged along the border of Oregon and Idaho.
 At a young age I began to show interest in gaining as much knowledge as possible. 
 As I grew the interest grew and I began to dive deep into the world of Psychology. 
 After graduating high school, I began my college career. 
 I recently graduated from Central Oregon Community College and am now enrolled at the Oregon State Cascades Campus.
 In the future I will graduate with a my PhD in Psychology.
 My ideal career is working with in a prison to assist with rehabilitation.

<h2> In My Free Time:</h2>

<p style: float: right;>I am a full-time college student, so most of my time is filled with either lectures or studdying. 
    When I am not busy with homework I fill my time with anything that I find relaxing. 
    While I am a sucker for a good beer and a great book, lately my favorite things have been cuddling up with my cat or exploring the nature around me with my friends and family.
